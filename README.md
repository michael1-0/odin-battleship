# odin-battleship
This project is a fun, modern twist on the classic Battleship game, built as part of The Odin Project using the MVC design pattern. The game's logic, the ship placements, move validations, and win conditionsâ€”is tucked away in the Model, while the View handles all the user-facing elements like ship displays and grid updates. The Controller bridges these two, ensuring smooth interactions and making sure your moves get accurately reflected on the board. It uses test-driven development using jest to keep everything running reliably by developing incrementally, one step at a time.
